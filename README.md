# Matching Pairs using Linked Lists

This project is a C++ program developed for the CS204 Advanced Programming course.  
It processes a list of "likes" relationships from an input file and organizes them using two separate linked lists:  
one for likes and one for matched pairs.

## Features
- Reads an input file containing "subject likes object" relationships.
- Uses **singly linked lists** to store and process the relationships.
- Detects **mutual likes** and moves them to a separate "taken" list.
- Ensures efficient memory management and input validation.
